# The list of the movies that I have watched

## This project was created using Flask, SQLite, HTML and some CSS/Bootstrap (Havent added JS yet)

### Deployed to Heroku
https://mylistofmoviesinflaskcrud.herokuapp.com/

In a effort to continue improving my dev skill I created this small project to put in practice everything I've recently learned about Flask, I had already some experience with Django therefore Flask wasnt that difficult to learn (at least the basics).

What I tried to achive is to create a website that let me add a movie a its Title, Year, Director, Genre and planning to add my own Score. At the moment this project let me visualize the movies already added, add a new movie and update/delete an existing one.

There are still plenty of things that I would be adding in the near future but of course the are more that I need to improve:
* Add feedback (notification message) for the user whenever we create, update or delete a movie.
* Improve the CSS code.
* And some other small aspect.
